# E-Portfolio Project

This e-portfolio project is a comprehensive showcase of my projects, style, skills, and experience. It is designed, developed, and maintained by Tevin Gathemia Gatheru. The project leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

## Overview

The e-portfolio is built with a focus on modern web development practices, ensuring that it is responsive, accessible, and easy to navigate. It features a clean and minimalist design that highlights the projects and skills without overwhelming the user.

## Technologies Used

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/): A powerful framework for building web applications. It provides a robust structure for developing single-page applications and is used for the core functionality of the e-portfolio. 
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development. It is used for styling the e-portfolio, ensuring that it is responsive and visually appealing across different devices. 
- [P5](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. It is used for creating interactive and dynamic elements within the e-portfolio.

## Project Structure

The project is structured in a modular way, with each section of the e-portfolio (e.g., projects, skills, experience) being a separate module. This structure allows for easy updates and maintenance.

## Getting Started

Please note that this repository contains only the build files of the e-portfolio project. The source code and the actual Angular project are not included. To view or contribute to the project, you will need access to the original Angular project repository.

If you are interested in viewing the e-portfolio, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Build Repository**: Use `git clone` to clone this repository to your local machine. This will download the build files necessary to run the e-portfolio.
2. **Serve the Build**: Since this repository contains only the build files, you will need to serve them using a web server. You can use any static file server for this purpose. For example, if you have 
   1. Node.js installed, you can use the `http-server` package. Install it globally with `npm install -g http-server`, navigate to the cloned repository's directory, and run `http-server` to serve the files.
   2. PHP installed, you can use `php -S localhost:8000` to start a local server.
3. **Access the e-Portfolio**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by your server) to view the e-portfolio.

For those interested in contributing to the project or accessing the source code, please contact the project maintainer.
